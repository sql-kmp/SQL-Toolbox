/*
    log_cache_tempdb.sql

    Aim of this script is to bind syslogs of the tempdb database to a named cache.

    The story behind that is tempdb tuning. Dedicated log caches usually always improve read performance.

    But wait! You can't bind individual system tables in tempdb, right? That will do the trick:
        - Bind model..syslogs to the named cache.
        - Restart ASE.

    This will rebind tempdb..syslogs every time SAP ASE is restarted (and syslogs in every new database as well).

    Parameter(s) to be set in advance:

        None.

    Changelog
    ---------

    2022-09-28  KMP Initial release.

    Known Issues
    ------------

    - The name of the cache is hard coded. It's assumed that a (log only) cache named log_cache exists.
