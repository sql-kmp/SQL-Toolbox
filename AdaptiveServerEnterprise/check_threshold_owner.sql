/*
    check_threshold_owner.sql

    This script returns all thresholds (from systhresholds) having an owner other than sa.

    Fix/mitigation:

        1. Log in with the dbowner's login,
        2. switch to the respective database (USE ?) and
        3. execute the generated statement.

    Parameter(s) to be set in advance:

        None.
