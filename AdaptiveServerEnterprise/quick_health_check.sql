    quick_health_check.sql

    This script does a quick health check. The following result sets are returned:
        - data and log usage
        - last dbcc results
        - last dbcc checks
        - some performance counters (20 seconds sample)
        - long running transactions
        - infected processes
        - monErrorLog (filtered)

    Parameter(s) to be set in advance: none.

    Changelog
    ---------
