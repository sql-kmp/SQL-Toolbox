/*
    fix_page_verify_option.sql

    This script reports databases with PAGE_VERIFY property set to other than CHECKSUM
    and generates a SQL query to fix this issue.

    The checksum for the data pages won't be calculated immediately or automatically.
    To do this, all objects/indexes must be rebuild after you have set this option to CHECKSUM.

    Parameter(s) to set or changes to make in advance:

        None.
