    03_analyze_xe_session_data.sql

    This script returns the recorded data of the XE session.

    The script is part of the SSMS solution "Troubleshooting query time-outs".
    
    Parameter(s) to set or changes to make in advance:

        @xe_file_pattern - Pattern for the XE session target file.

    Changelog
    ---------
    
    2024-02-01  KMP Initial release.

    Known Issues
    ------------

        - Session name is static.
        - The script assumes that the name of the target file begins with
          the name of the XE session (see step 1).
