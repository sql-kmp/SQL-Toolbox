/*
    01_create_xe_session.sql

    This script creates the extended events session to capture aborted batches.

    The script is part of the SSMS solution "Troubleshooting query time-outs".

    sqlserver.server_principal_name, sqlserver.session_server_principal_name,
    and sqlserver.username can differ (execution within another context). Hence,
    all of them are captured.
    
    Parameter(s) to set or changes to make in advance:

        None.
