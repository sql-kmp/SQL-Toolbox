# Recommended MS SQL Related Tools and Scripts

SQL Server specific online tools that might come at handy:

- Are columnstore indexes an option?: [ColumnScore](https://columnscore.com/)
- Share execution plans: [Paste The Plan](https://www.brentozar.com/pastetheplan/)
- Parse SQL Server IO, and time statistics: [Statistics Parser](https://statisticsparser.com/)
- Make queries look pretty (frankly, not only for SQL Server): [Formatting your code](format-sql.com)

Simply awesome and strongly recommended:

- [SQL Server Diagnostic Queries](https://glennsqlperformance.com/resources/) by Glenn Alan Berry
- [Microsoft SQL Server Versions List](https://sqlserverbuilds.blogspot.com/) - Not a tool by definition, but a very useful overview of all SQL Server versions incl. patches (SP, CU, Hot Fixes)
- [SolarWinds Plan Explorer](https://www.sentryone.com/plan-explorer)

Interesting, but currently not completely tested and evaluated, simply because the day has only 24 hours:
