# Recommended Tools and Scripts

Simply awesome and strongly recommended:

- [First Responder Kit](https://www.brentozar.com/first-aid/) by Brent Ozar
- [SQL Server Maintenance Solution](https://ola.hallengren.com/) by Ola Hallengren
- [sp_whoisactive](http://whoisactive.com/) by Adam Machanic
- [SQL Server Diagnostic Queries](https://glennsqlperformance.com/resources/) by Glenn Alan Berry

Interesting, but currently not completely tested and evaluated, simply because the day has only 24 hours:

- [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/) by a whole, awesome team
- [Darling Data: SQL Server Troubleshooting Scripts](https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData) by Erik Darling
- [SQL Server Toolbox](https://github.com/SparkhoundSQL/sql-server-toolbox) by William Assaf
- [MinionWare](https://www.minionware.net/) - I've just heard but not investigated further yet.

The lists are by no means complete and will be updated over time.
